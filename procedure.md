# Multipliers

## Components Required - 

* 6 AND gates
* 2 XOR gates

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag 4 AND gates to the working area and place them infront of A1,B1,B0 and A0.
*  Connect the inputs of the first(uppermost) AND gate to A1 and B1.
*  Connect the inputs of the second AND gate to A1 and B0 and those of third AND gate to B1 and A0.
*  Connect the inputs of fourth AND gate to A0 and B0.
*  Drag a fifth AND gate and connect its inputs to outputs of second and third AND gates.
*  Drag a XOR gate and connect its inputs to outputs of second and third AND gates.
*  Drag another AND gate and connect its inputs to outputs of first and fifth AND gates.
*  Drag another XOR gate and connect its inputs to outputs of first and fifth AND gates.
*  Finally connect C0 to output of fourth AND gate, C1 to output of first XOR gate, C2 to output of second XOR gate and C3 to output of sixth AND gate.
*  Set the values of A1,B1,B0,A0 and click "Simulate".

## Observations - 

* Upon the completion of simulation, the output bits will display the product of the numbers (A1A0) and (B1B0).
* If the circuit has been made as descibed above a "Success" message will appear upon clicking "Submit".
